ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the JPEG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.


It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM and AT&T, as well as a pending Japanese patent of
Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining
one or more licenses.  For this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been
removed from the free JPEG software.  (Since arithmetic coding provides only a
marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many
implementors will support it.  If you do obtain the necessary licenses,
contact jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net for a copy of our arithmetic coding modules.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.
